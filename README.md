Overview

This script is designed to provide comprehensive security monitoring and defense mechanisms for a target IP. It includes features for detecting and defending against various types of attacks, such as port scans, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, ARP spoofing, and more. The script also includes mechanisms for monitoring keyloggers and filesystem changes, sending alerts, and blocking malicious IP addresses.
Features

    Network Traffic Monitoring: Detects port scans and anomalous network activity.
    DoS Attack Monitoring: Identifies and responds to potential DoS attacks.
    ARP Spoofing Detection: Monitors for ARP spoofing attempts.
    System Log Monitoring: Observes system logs for suspicious login attempts.
    Web Server Log Monitoring: Detects common web attacks.
    Filesystem Monitoring: Watches for critical filesystem changes.
    Keylogger Detection: Identifies and disables keyloggers.
    Counter-Scan: Performs counter-scanning to detect scanning attempts.
    Alerts: Sends email alerts and plays a sound alert on detection of malicious activities.
    Dependency Installation: Automatically installs required dependencies.

Installation
Prerequisites

    A Unix-based system (e.g., Linux)
    sudo privileges for installing dependencies and modifying firewall rules

Dependencies

The script requires the following packages:

    tcpdump
    arpwatch
    mailutils
    inotify-tools
    iptables-persistent
    nmap
    alsa-utils
    mpg123

Installation Steps

    Clone the Repository

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/defensive-script.git
cd defensive-script

Make the Script Executable

bash

chmod +x defensive_script.sh

Run the Installation Script

bash

./defensive_script.sh install_dependencies

Configure Sound Alerts

Ensure you have a sound file for alerts:

bash

cp /path/to/your/zombie_alert.wav /path/to/your_script_directory/

Run the Script

To start the script and monitor a specific target IP:

bash

    sudo ./defensive_script.sh <target-ip>

    Replace <target-ip> with the IP address you want to monitor.

Usage
Command Line Options

    install_dependencies: Installs required dependencies.
    monitor_network: Starts network traffic monitoring.
    monitor_dos_attacks: Monitors for DoS attacks.
    monitor_arp_spoofing: Monitors for ARP spoofing.
    monitor_system_logs: Monitors system logs for exploitation attempts.
    monitor_web_logs: Monitors web server logs for common attacks.
    monitor_filesystem: Monitors critical filesystem changes.
    monitor_keyloggers: Detects and disables keyloggers.
    perform_counter_scan: Performs counter-scanning to detect scanning attempts.

Example

To monitor a specific IP and start all the monitoring tasks:
